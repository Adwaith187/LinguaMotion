# **Sign2Speak(S2S)**-*Empowering Silence*
*Sign language to text and audio with Generative AI.*

# Inspiration:

The World Health Organisation stated that approximately 70 million people in the world are deaf-mutes.A total of 360 million people are deaf,and 32 million of these are children.
   
 Our idea aims to reduce the barrier of  communication faced by deaf-mutes around the globe.
 
 Our project revolves around building a sign language to text and speech converter.It will implement features of Machine Learning and generative AI to take Sign Language as the input using the Computer camera and converts the given input to text and then to speech instataneously
